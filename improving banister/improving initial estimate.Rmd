```{r purling, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
#### run this to purl the r code to the /R file, this seems to not be able to run with the knit
knitr::purl(input = "calc_power_funcs.Rmd",
            output = stringr::str_c(rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file(),"/R/calc_power_funcs.R") #puts file in /R)
            ) 

``` 


```{r setup, include=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
devtools::load_all() #can't purl this function, it will cause in infinite loop when another document purls
```

We will make a couple of assumptions: 

p_0 is exact as giv ljkjk

```{r}
RLS
```
